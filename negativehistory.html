On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

    <h2>Racism</h2>
    <h3>Racism and discrimination is a big topic talked in and out of Greek Life. When looking further into the history, I came across many articles discussing the racism that was experienced by students due to Greek life originally being prodominately white organizations. In the article, Race and Racism in the Fraternity and Sorority Life:Historical Overview, an important note that is highlighted in this article is the racist background of sororities and fraternities and how people of color were not allowed to join sororities or fraternities until a couple decades ago. To fight this, the National-Panhellenic Council, or also commonly referred to as the Divine 9, was created to allow people of color to have the same opportunity to network and find a sisterhood/brotherhood on their own terms. This article focuses on the timeline in which people of color were allowed to join. Religion also played a big part of Greek life, in which most Greek life chapters were Catholic or Protestant. There were restrictive policies in place to prevent people of color from joining, but this also had to do with the discriminative laws in place of the government during these times. The biggest Greek life school, University of Alabama did not allow people of color to join until 2013

        <h2>Hazing</h2>
        <h3>A widely discussed topic in all of Greek Life is hazing. Hazing refers to any activity, behavior, or initiation ritual that involves the harassment, abuse, or humiliation of individuals as a way of initiating them into a group, organization, or team. Hazing is often associated with certain social groups, including fraternities, sororities, sports teams, military units, and other organizations with initiation or membership rituals. When researching hazing taking place of college campuses, I came across the article, Death by Hazing, which magnifies on the state and federal laws that are in place in order to prevent hazing in organizations. It goes over stories that from the past that have happened from hazing that have led to deaths and serious injuries. It describes specific events in certain fraternities and sororities that made their members hike without phones and shoes and limited amounts of water. “The purpose of this article is to review the current state of the law and propose a solution that will help decrease the number of deaths caused by hazing each year.” The history of hazing is mentioned, as Plato in his academy encouraged the members to play practical jokes on the new members. New York was the first state to implement anti-hazing laws. Most states now have anti-hazing laws that can have people end up with punishments, such as jail time if found convicted of hazing. “Watson’s amendment, H.R. 1207, also known as the Hazing Prohibition Act of 2003, proposed adding a new subsection “(s)” that would suspend a student’s eligibility for financial aid if the student is sanctioned for hazing offenses, similar to the way subsection “(r)” suspends eligibility for drug related offenses.” This amendment made it easier for institutions to charge people involved with hazing by making the definition of hazing more broad. Hazing is not only limited to Greek organizations, but also clubs as well.
